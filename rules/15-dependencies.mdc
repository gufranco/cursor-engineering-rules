# Dependencies

## Before Adding
1. **Ask permission** - Never add without approval
2. **Check existing** - Maybe already solved
3. **Evaluate** - Recent commits? Vulnerabilities?
4. **Size** - Avoid heavy packages for simple tasks

## Rules
- Pin exact versions: `"1.2.3"` not `"^1.2.3"`
- One package at a time
- Run `npm audit` after adding
- Use `--save-dev` for dev dependencies

## Checklist
- [ ] User approved
- [ ] No existing solution
- [ ] Actively maintained
- [ ] Acceptable bundle size
- [ ] No critical vulnerabilities
