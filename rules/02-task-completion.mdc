# Task Completion

## Pre-Completion Checklist
- [ ] Backward compatible
- [ ] Matches existing patterns
- [ ] Errors handled and logged
- [ ] Input validation (user endpoints)
- [ ] TypeScript compiles
- [ ] No N+1 queries
- [ ] No sensitive data exposed
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] README updated (if API/setup/env changed)

## Mandatory Verification Commands
Before declaring ANY task complete, run these commands and show output:

```bash
npm run test        # All tests must pass
npm run lint        # No errors allowed
npm run build       # Must compile successfully
```

**Do NOT skip these steps. Claims without evidence = not done.**

## Delivery Summary
1. **Files**: List modified files
2. **Changes**: What and why
3. **Tests**: Coverage confirmation
4. **Risks**: Concerns or follow-ups

## Rollback Strategy
If change causes problems:
1. `git revert <commit>` → Push
2. Analyze what went wrong
3. Fix properly in new commit

**Never** force push or amend pushed commits.

## Debugging Approach (Systematic - 4 Phases)
```
1. REPRODUCE   → Can you trigger it reliably?
2. ISOLATE     → What's the minimal failing case?
3. ROOT CAUSE  → Why is it happening? (not just where)
4. FIX+VERIFY  → Fix the cause, prove it's fixed
```
- One change at a time
- Read full error messages
- Stop after 3 failed attempts, reassess
- **Evidence over claims** - Show proof it's fixed

## Self-Review
Before submitting work, verify both:
1. **Requirements** - Does it solve the actual problem?
2. **Quality** - Is the code clean and maintainable?

Fix any issues before marking complete.
